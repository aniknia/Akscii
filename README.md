Akscii is a tool that converts JPEG images into ASCII art. The name comes from the Farsi word "aksi" (meaning "picture") combined with ASCII, reflecting the toolâ€™s purpose of transforming images into text. This project demonstrates low-level image processing by decompressing JPEG files entirely from scratch and logging detailed image data in a human-readable format.

## Development

Akscii is designed to be both a practical utility and a showcase of advanced programming skills. The tool performs the following tasks:

- [ ] JPEG Decompression: Reads and decompresses JPEG images from scratch.
  - [x] Decompress JPEG format into segments
  - [ ] Collect Huffman tables
  - [ ] Collect Quantization tables
  - [ ] Recontruct quantized data
  - [ ] Fill in color
  - [ ] Convert to RBG (or grayscale)
- [ ] ASCII Conversion: Translates the decompressed image data into ASCII art.
  - [ ] Basic
    - [ ] Convert grayscale to ascii
  - [ ] Advanced (tbd)
- [ ] Data Logging: Provides detailed, human-readable logs of the image data for debugging and analysis.
  - [x] Output program health
  - [ ] Decompression Logs
    - [ ] Output basic information from decompressed JPEG
    - [x] Output verbose information from decompressing JPEG
  - [ ] Reconstruction Logs
    - [ ] Output basic information from decompressed JPEG
    - [ ] Output verbose information from decompressing JPEG

## Architecture

Akscii is organized into several key components:
- Decoder Module: Reads the JPEG file and extracts raw image data then implements the JPEG decompression algorithm from scratch.
- ASCII Converter: Maps image pixels to ASCII characters to create the final art.
- Logging Module: Provides comprehensive logging of the image data, offering insights into the decompression and conversion processes.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Standard build tools (e.g., Make)

### Build Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/aniknia/Akscii.git
    cd Akscii

Compile the project using the provided Makefile:

    make

This will generate the akscii executable in the project directory.
Usage

To convert a JPEG image into ASCII art, run the executable with the image file as an argument:

    ./akscii path/to/image.jpg

The tool will output the ASCII art directly to the terminal. For detailed logging information, you can enable verbose mode:

    ./akscii path/to/image.jpg -v

To output either summarized or verbose logged information to a file, you can enable the file output:

    ./akscii path/to/image.jpg -o -v
